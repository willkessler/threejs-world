## Flyover Simulator

This Chrome Browser Extension simulates flying over an endless landscape, every time you pop a new browser tab.

### Installing

Because this extension uses `simplex-noise.js` as a submodule, make sure you `git clone` using the `--recursive` flag to get the submodule.

### Just trying it out to see what it looks like:

You can also just try this out with `python3 -m http.server 50001` and surf to `localhost:50001/landscape5.html` to see the effect without installing as an extension.
