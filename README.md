## Flyover Simulator

This is a Chrome Browser Extension. It simulates flying over an endless landscape, every time you pop a new browser tab.

You can also just try this out with `python3 -m http.server 50001` and surf to `localhost:50001/landscape5.html` to see the effect without installing as an extension.
